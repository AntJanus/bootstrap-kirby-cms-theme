Text: In the coming weeks, I’ll be working on a redesign and restructuring of my website as well as the launch of several sister sites.

Ahhh, so I visited the Wayback Machine and decided to look through all of my redesigns (or whichever ones were captured). I usually don’t take screenshots or save any sort of memento so this little site was of great help to me  Watch out! I’m going to spam my blog post with pictures and explanations of my journey!
